      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The features of the apps, as well as their security and privacy details shown in the table, are conditional on the ease of access to this information (on 12th April 2021).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Move the mouse over the columns' header to get a more detailed explanation about the column (the columns with the information have a dashed underline).</li>
        <br>
        <li>If an application has two versions of its product and one of them is healthcare-based, the healthcare-based was analyzed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The features of each health-based platform were gathered for the most complete version (e.g. If there are three pricing plans for an application, the features of the most complete one was selected).</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="qmark">&#63;</span> in any column means that we have not found anything about it. Obviously, no app says explicitly they are not compliant with security standards. However, all of them should be GDPR compliant to be legal. HIPAA and SOC2 (and others) are aditional security standards. Obvioulsy, they also do not state their lack of some feature. </li>
        <br>
        <li>We only state GDPR in the [Security standards] column when there was an official document from the application stating GDPR compliance.</li>
      </ul>
